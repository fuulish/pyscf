#
# DFT can parse the user defined XC functional, following the rules:
# * The given functional description must be a one-line string.
# * The functional description is case-insensitive.
# * The functional description string has two parts, separated by ",".  The
#   first part describes the exchange functional, the second is the correlation
#   functional.
#   - If "," not appeared in string, the entire string is considered as
#     X functional.
#   - To neglect X functional (just apply C functional), leave blank in the
#     first part, eg description=',vwn' for pure VWN functional
# * The functional name can be placed in arbitrary order.  Two names needs to
#   be separated by operators + or -.  Blank spaces are ignored.
#   NOTE the parser only reads operators + - *.  / is not supported.
# * A functional name is associated with one factor.  If the factor is not
#   given, it is assumed equaling 1.
# * String "HF" stands for exact exchange (HF K matrix).  It is allowed to
#   put "HF" in C (correlation) functional part.
# * Be careful with the libxc convention on GGA functional, in which the LDA
#   contribution is included.
